  "description": "# Introduction The basic aim of this project is to be able to provide a local development environment for Kotlin (JVM)/Java developers wishing to move to Cloud frameworks, using Serverless Framework (https://www.serverless.com/). It does so by utilizing spring boot as the framework for running and managing server. However, spring boot wouldn't be included in the final deployment build, so it should look like a vanilla Java/Kotlin project!",
